## Task

The task is to implement a single page where some aggregated reports (mainly tables) of the collected feedbacks are listed.
1. Calculate the number of feedbacks of branch `Branch REWE 05`.
2. Determine the frequency distribution of organization `FitX` w.r.t. `quality`.
3. Determine a cross table for `Douglas` w.r.t. `age group` and `quality` where entries are numbers of feedbacks.
4. Determine a ranking for all branches of `BMW` w.r.t. average of `quality`.
5. Calculate all net promoter scores* for all organizations and display them in a table.

_*CALCULATION OF NPS: Those who respond to a NPS question with a score of 9 to 10 are called Promoters, and are considered likely to exhibit value-creating behaviors, such as buying more, remaining customers for longer, and making more positive referrals to other potential customers. Those who respond with a score of 0 to 6 are labeled Detractors, and they are believed to be less likely to exhibit the value-creating behaviors. Responses of 7 and 8 are labeled Passives, and their behavior falls between Promoters and Detractors. The Net Promoter Score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of customers who are Detractors from the percentage of customers who are Promoters._
